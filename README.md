# Supervised Learning Challenge - Credit Risk Classification

# Project Overview

In this project, a machine learning model was developed for credit risk classification based on historical lending data. The goal was to predict whether a loan is healthy or high-risk to assist in risk assessment and decision-making processes. Using a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company, the model will identify the creditworthiness of borrowers (applicants).

# Project Requirements

1. Data Preparation:
    * Split the data into training and testing sets.
    * Create labels and features for model training.
2. Model Development:
    * Fit a logistic regression model using training data.
    * Evaluate model performance with confusion matrix and classification report.
3. Analysis Report:
    * Provide an overview of the analysis.
    * Describe accuracy, precision, and recall scores.
    * Summarize the model results and recommend its use.
  
# Project Results Summary

The credit risk classification analysis project successfully developed a logistic regression model to predict credit risk categories for loans based on historical lending data. The model achieved high accuracy in distinguishing between healthy and high-risk loans, with precision scores of 1.00 for healthy loans and 0.84 for high-risk loans. Additionally, the model demonstrated recall scores of 0.99 for healthy loans and 0.94 for high-risk loans, indicating its effectiveness in correctly identifying loan categories. The analysis report recommends the model for credit risk prediction, highlighting its strong performance metrics and balanced approach in risk assessment for the company.
